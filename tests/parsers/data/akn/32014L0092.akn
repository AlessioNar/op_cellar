Fragmentation of the internal market is detrimental to competitiveness, growth and job creation within the Union. Eliminating direct and indirect obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market is essential for its completion. Union action with respect to the internal market in the retail financial services sector has already substantially contributed to developing cross-border activity of payment service providers, improving consumer choice and increasing the quality and transparency of the offers.</p>

          <p>However, as indicated by the European Parliament in its resolution of <date date="2012-07-04">4 July 2012</date> with recommendations to the Commission on Access to Basic Banking Services, more must be done to improve and develop the internal market for retail banking. Currently, the lack of transparency and comparability of fees as well as the difficulties in switching payment accounts still create barriers to the deployment of a fully integrated market contributing to low competition in the retail banking sector. Those problems must be tackled and high-quality standards must be achieved.</p>

          <p>The current conditions of the internal market could deter payment service providers from exercising their freedom to establish or to provide services within the Union because of the difficulty in attracting customers when entering a new market. Entering new markets often entails large investment. Such investment is only justified if the provider foresees sufficient opportunities and a corresponding demand from consumers. The low level of mobility of consumers with respect to retail financial services is to a large extent due to the lack of transparency and comparability as regards the fees and services on offer, as well as difficulties in relation to the switching of payment accounts. Those factors also stifle demand. This is particularly true in the cross-border context.</p>

          <p>Moreover, significant barriers to the completion of the internal market in the area of payment accounts may be created by the fragmentation of existing national regulatory frameworks. Existing provisions at national level with respect to payment accounts, and particularly with respect to the comparability of fees and payment account switching, diverge. For switching, the lack of uniform binding measures at Union level has led to divergent practices and measures at national level. Those differences are even more marked in the area of comparability of fees, where no measures, even of a self-regulatory nature, exist at Union level. Should those differences become more significant in the future, as payment service providers tend to tailor their practices to national markets, this would raise the cost of operating across borders relative to the costs faced by domestic providers and would therefore make the pursuit of business on a cross-border basis less attractive. Cross-border activity in the internal market is hampered by obstacles to consumers opening a payment account abroad. Existing restrictive eligibility criteria may prevent Union citizens from moving freely within the Union. Providing all consumers with access to a payment account will permit their participation in the internal market and allow them to reap the benefits of the internal market.</p>

          <p>Moreover, since some prospective customers do not open payment accounts, either because they are denied them or because they are not offered adequate products, the potential demand for payment account services in the Union is currently not fully exploited. Wider consumer participation in the internal market would further incentivise payment service providers to enter new markets. Also, creating the conditions to allow all consumers to access a payment account is a necessary means of fostering their participation in the internal market and of allowing them to reap the benefits the internal market has brought about.</p>

          <p>Transparency and comparability of fees were considered at Union level in a self-regulatory initiative, initiated by the banking industry. However, no final agreement was reached on that initiative. As regards switching, the common principles established in 2008 by the European Banking Industry Committee provide a model mechanism for switching between payment accounts offered by banks located in the same Member State. However, given their non-binding nature, those common principles have been applied in an inconsistent manner throughout the Union and with ineffective results. Moreover, the common principles address payment account switching at national level only and do not address cross-border switching. Finally, as regards access to a basic payment account, Commission Recommendation 2011/442/EU<authorialNote GUID="E0005" class="FOOTNOTE" placement="bottom"><p>Commission Recommendation 2011/442/EU of <date date="2011-07-18">18 July 2011</date> on access to a basic payment account (<ref href="/akn/eu/documentCollection/L/gu/2011-07-21/190/!main#page_87">OJ L 190, 21.7.2011, p. 87</ref>).</p></authorialNote> invited Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure its application at the latest six months after its publication.

          <p>In order to support effective and smooth financial mobility in the long term, it is vital to establish a uniform set of rules to tackle the issue of low customer mobility, and in particular to improve comparison of payment account services and fees and to incentivise payment account switching, as well as to avoid discrimination on the basis of residency against consumers who intend to open and use a payment account on a cross-border basis. Moreover, it is essential to adopt adequate measures to foster consumers’ participation in the payment accounts market. Those measures will incentivise entry for payment service providers in the internal market and ensure a level playing field, thereby strengthening competition and the efficient allocation of resources within the Union’s financial retail market to the benefit of businesses and consumers. Also, transparent fee information and switching possibilities, combined with the right of access to a payment account with basic features, will allow Union citizens to move and shop around more easily within the Union, thereby benefitting from a fully functioning internal market in the area of retail financial services, and will contribute to the further development of the internal market.</p>

The provisions of this Directive concerning access to payment accounts with basic features should apply only to credit institutions. All provisions of this Directive should concern payment accounts through which consumers are able to carry out the following transactions: place funds, withdraw cash and execute and receive payment transactions to and from third parties, including the execution of credit transfers. As a consequence, accounts with more limited functions should be excluded. For example, accounts such as savings accounts, credit card accounts where funds are usually paid in for the sole purpose of repaying a credit card debt, current account mortgages or e-money accounts should in principle be excluded from the scope of this Directive. However, should those accounts be used for day-to-day payment transactions and should they comprise all of the functions listed above, they will fall within the scope of this Directive. Accounts held by businesses, even small or micro enterprises, unless held in a personal capacity, should fall outside the scope of this Directive. Member States should be able to choose to extend the application of this Directive to other payment service providers and other payment accounts, for example those which offer more limited payment functions.</p>

EBA should ensure that only one term is used for each service in any official language of each Member State which is also an official language of the institutions of the Union. This means that different terms can be used for the same service in different Member States sharing the same official language of the institutions of the Union, thereby taking into account national specificities.

EBA should therefore, after consulting national authorities and after consumer testing, develop draft implementing technical standards regarding a standardised presentation format for the fee information document and the statement of fees and the common symbols, in order to ensure that they are understandable and comparable for consumers. The same format, order of items and headings should be followed for every fee information document and statement of fees in each Member State, allowing consumers to compare the two documents, thereby maximising understanding and use of the information. The fee information document and statement of fees should be clearly distinguishable from other communications. Furthermore, when developing those formats, EBA should also take into account the fact that Member States may choose to provide the fee information document and the statement of fees together with information required pursuant to other Union or national legislative acts on payment accounts and related services.</p>

Payment service providers should be able to use brand names in their contractual, commercial and marketing information to consumers, as long as they clearly identify the applicable corresponding standardised term. Where they choose to use brand names in the fee information document or statement of fees, this should be in addition to the standardised terms as a secondary designation, such as in brackets or in a smaller font size.</p>

          <p>Comparison websites that are independent are an effective means for consumers to assess the merits of different payment account offers in one place. Such websites can provide the right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complete and comprehensive, by enabling users to obtain more detailed information where this is of interest to them. They should aim at including the broadest possible range of offers, so as to give a representative overview, while also covering a significant part of the market. They can also reduce search costs as consumers will not need to collect information separately from payment service providers. It is crucial that the information given on such websites be trustworthy, impartial and transparent and that consumers be informed of the availability of such websites.

          <p>In order to obtain impartial information on fees charged and interest rates applied in relation to payment accounts, consumers should be able to use publicly accessible comparison websites that are operationally independent from payment service providers, which means that no payment service provider should be given favourable treatment in search results. Member States should therefore ensure that consumers have free access to at least one such website in their respective territories. Such comparison websites may be operated by, or on behalf of, the competent authorities, other public authorities and/or private operators. The function of comparing fees connected to payment accounts may also be fulfilled by existing websites comparing a broad range of financial or non-financial products. Such websites should be operated in accordance with specified quality criteria including the requirement to provide details of their owners, to provide accurate and up-to-date information, to state the time of the last update, to set out clear, objective criteria on which the comparison will be based and to include a broad range of payment account offers covering a significant part of the market. Member States should be able to determine how often comparison websites are to review and update the information they provide to consumers, taking into account the frequency with which payment service providers generally update their fee information. Member States should also determine what constitutes a broad range of payment account offers covering a significant part of the market, by assessing, for example, how many payment service providers exist and therefore whether a simple majority or less would be sufficient and/or market share and/or their geographic location. A comparison website should compare the fees payable for services contained in the list of most representative services linked to payment accounts, integrating Union-level terminology.</p>
          <p>It is appropriate that Member States should be able to require such websites to compare other information, for example information on determinants of the level of services provided by payment service providers, such as the number and location of branches or automated teller machines. Where there is only one website in a Member State and that website ceases to operate or ceases to comply with the quality criteria, the Member State should ensure that consumers have access within a reasonable time to another comparison website at national level.</p>

          <p>It is current practice for payment service providers to offer a payment account in a package with products or services other than services linked to a payment account, such as insurance products or financial advice. That practice can be a means for payment service providers to diversify their offers and to compete against each other, and in the end it can be beneficial for consumers. However, the Commission’s 2009 study on tying practices in the financial sector, as well as relevant consultations and consumer complaints, have shown that payment service providers may offer payment accounts packaged with products not requested by consumers which are not essential for payment accounts, such as household insurance. Moreover, it has been observed that those practices may reduce transparency and comparability of prices, limit purchasing options for consumers and negatively impact upon their mobility. Therefore, Member States should ensure that when payment service providers offer packaged payment accounts consumers are provided with information on whether it is possible to purchase the payment account separately and if so, provide separate information regarding the applicable costs and fees associated with each of the other products or services included in the package that can be purchased separately.</p>

          <p>The process for switching payment accounts should be harmonised across the Union. At present, existing measures at national level are extremely diverse and do not guarantee an adequate level of consumer protection in all Member States. The provision of legislative measures establishing the main principles to be followed by payment service providers when providing such a service in each Member State would improve the functioning of the internal market for both consumers and payment service providers. On the one hand, it would guarantee a level playing field for consumers who may be interested in opening a payment account in a different Member State, as it would ensure that an equivalent level of protection is offered. On the other hand, it would reduce the differences between the regulatory measures in place at national level and would therefore reduce the administrative burden for payment service providers which intend to offer their services on a cross-border basis.

Even in those cases, a refusal can only be justified where the consumer does not comply with that legislation and not because the procedure to check compliance with the legislation is too burdensome or costly.

Besides, there may be cases in which the previous refusal of an application for a payment account may be necessary in order to identify consumers who could benefit from a payment account on more advantageous terms.

Information also needs to be provided regarding the guidance that consumer organisations and national authorities may provide to consumers.

          <p>Member States should designate competent authorities empowered to ensure enforcement of this Directive, and ensure that they are granted investigation and enforcement powers and adequate resources necessary for the performance of their duties. Competent authorities could act for certain aspects of this Directive by application to courts competent to grant a legal decision, including, where appropriate, by appeal. This could enable Member States, in particular where provisions of this Directive were transposed into civil law, to leave the enforcement of those provisions to the relevant bodies and to the courts. Member States should be able to designate different competent authorities in order to enforce the wide-ranging obligations laid down in this Directive. For instance, for some provisions, Member States could designate competent authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection, while for others, they could decide to designate prudential supervisors. The option to designate different competent authorities should not affect the obligations for ongoing supervision and cooperation between the competent authorities, as provided for in this Directive.</p>

          <p>A review of this Directive should be carried out five years after its entry into force in order to take account of market developments, such as the emergence of new types of payment accounts and payment services, as well as developments in other areas of Union law and the experiences of Member States. The report based on the review should include a list of infringement proceedings initiated by the Commission in relation to this Directive. It should also include an assessment of the average fee levels in Member States for payment accounts falling within the scope of this Directive, of the question whether the measures introduced have improved consumer understanding of payment account fees, the comparability of payment accounts and the ease of switching payment accounts and of the number of account holders who have switched payment accounts since the transposition of this Directive.</p>
          <p>It should also analyse the number of providers offering payment accounts with basic features and the number of such accounts that have been opened, including by previously unbanked consumers, examples of best practices among Member States for reducing consumer exclusion from access to payment services, and the average annual fees levied for payment accounts with basic features. It should also assess the costs and benefits of implementing Union-wide portability of payment accounts, the feasibility of a framework for ensuring automated redirection of payments from one payment account to another within the same Member State combined with automated notifications to payees or payers when their transfers are redirected, and of extending the switching services to cases where the receiving and transferring payment service provider are located in different Member States. It should also include an assessment of the effectiveness of existing measures and the need for additional measures to increase financial inclusion and to assist vulnerable members of society in relation to over-indebtedness. Also, it should assess whether the provisions on the information to be provided by payment service providers when offering packaged products are sufficient or whether additional measures are needed. It should also assess the need for additional measures with regard to comparison websites and the need for an accreditation of comparison websites. The Commission should submit that report to the European Parliament and to the Council accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals.</p>
